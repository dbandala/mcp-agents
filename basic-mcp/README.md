##Guide to Design and Implement an MCP (Model Context Protocol)

1. Define Your Use Case
Start by clearly identifying:

* What kinds of models are interacting? (e.g., vision model, language model, planning model)
* What context do they need to share? (e.g., memory, state, goals, environment)
* What is the orchestration goal? (e.g., collaborative task solving, decision-making, autonomous control)


2. Core Concepts of MCP
A typical MCP system involves:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Context Object | A structured, evolving object containing shared state |
| Model Roles | Each model/component plays a defined role (e.g., planner, actor) |
| Memory Layer | Tracks persistent state, task history, etc. |
| Protocol Rules | Governs how/when context is updated or passed |
| Controller/Coordinator | Orchestrates the order and flow of communication between models |

3. Architecture Design
+-------------+      +-------------------+     +--------------+
|   Planner   | <--> |  Model Context     | <-> |  Controller  |
+-------------+      |  Protocol (MCP)    |     +--------------+
      ^              +-------------------+              |
      |                    |                             v
+-------------+      +-------------------+     +--------------+
|  Perception | <--> | Shared Context     | <-> |  Memory Base |
+-------------+      +-------------------+     +--------------+

4. Define the Context Object
This object is shared across models. It typically includes:
```json
{
  "task_id": "001",
  "current_goal": "Assemble part A",
  "current_state": {
    "robot_arm_position": [10, 5],
    "camera_feed": "image_001.jpg"
  },
  "memory": {
    "prior_actions": ["pick", "place"],
    "success_rate": 0.92
  },
  "environment": {
    "light_conditions": "dim",
    "temperature": 25.3
  }
}
```

5. Protocol Rules (MCP Layer)
Define:
* Model Permissions: what parts of context each model can read/write
* Update Policies: how updates are merged or resolved
* Trigger Conditions: when a model should act (e.g., state change, new goal)
* Error Handling: how to resolve inconsistencies or failed tasks

6. Implementation Strategy
a) Choose a Coordination Framework
** Python + asyncio for async orchestration
** LangGraph / CrewAI / AutoGen if using LLMs
** Kafka/Event Bus for distributed systems
b) Create Model Wrappers
Each model is wrapped with an interface that reads/writes to the context and respects the protocol.
c) Implement a Context Manager
Central service that:
**Stores and updates context
** Validates access
** Logs changes
d) Simulate Interactions
Start with mocked components to simulate message passing and state evolution.
